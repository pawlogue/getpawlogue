    The wind whipped through the desolate town, carrying with it the mournful cries of seagulls. Rain lashed against the weathered windows of the old lighthouse, casting eerie shadows that danced across the walls. Inside, a lone figure sat hunched over a worn wooden desk, their gaze fixed on a flickering candle. A weathered journal lay open before them, its pages filled with cryptic symbols and faded ink. A sudden gust of wind rattled the window, and the figure's eyes flickered, a spark of fear igniting within them. They knew they were not alone in the lighthouse. A presence, dark and sinister, lurked in the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.
